           <h2 id="aboutMe">About Me</h2>
           <p>Currently in the early statges of the Manchester Codes Fast track Bootcamp with the goal 
               of changing career. After an early foray into coding many years ago which I loved, I stumbled into
               the world of banking and now want to get back to doing something I enjoy and really gets my brain
               working. <br>
               When I'm not working or learning to code, I love being outdoors, whether that be playing sport or on
               top of a hill on my bike, nothing beats fresh clean air in your lungs! <br>
               I have a two year old daughter who keeps me on my toes. She is a bundle of joy and energy, although lie
               ins are now a thing of the past, but it's a small price to pay for the happiness she brings.
